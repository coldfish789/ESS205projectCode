# Code
All code files are included in `/Code` .
- [Euler_Heun_UniformMagnetic.py](Code/Euler_Heun_UniformMagnetic.py)
  
  This is the code for calculating the motion of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field using the Euler method and Heun method.

- [RK4_UniformMagnetic.m](Code/RK4_UniformMagnetic.m)
  
  This is the code for calculating the motion of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field using the RK4 method.

- [**RK4_EarthMagnetic.c**](Code/RK4_EarthMagnetic.c)
  
  This is the code for calculating the motion of charged particles in Earth's magnetic field using the RK4 method.

- [TraceFigure.m](Code/TraceFigure.m)

  This code is using for ploting the trajectory and projecting the trajectory of particles.
